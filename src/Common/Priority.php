 * Priority contains metadata that controls the relative ordering of task processing when tasks are

 * Priority is attached to workflows and activities. By default, activities and child workflows
 * inherit Priority from the workflow that created them, but may override fields when an activity is
 * started or modified.
 *
 * For all fields, the field not present or equal to zero/empty string means to inherit the value
 * from the calling workflow, or if there is no calling workflow, then use the default value.
