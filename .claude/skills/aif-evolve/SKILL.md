# Evolve - Skill Self-Improvement

Analyze project context, patches, and codebase to improve existing skills. Makes AI Factory smarter with every run.

## Core Idea

```
patches (past mistakes) + project context + codebase patterns
    ↓
analyze recurring problems, tech-specific pitfalls, project conventions
    ↓
enhance skills with project-specific rules, guards, and patterns
```

## Patch Consumption Policy

Use a two-layer learning model:

1. **Raw patches** (`paths.patches`, default: `.ai-factory/patches/*.md`) are the source material.
2. **Skill-context rules** (`.ai-factory/skill-context/*`) are the compact, reusable output.

Policy across workflow skills:
- `/aif-evolve` is the primary raw-patch analyzer. It processes patches **incrementally** using a cursor.
- `/aif-implement`, `/aif-fix`, and `/aif-improve` should prefer skill-context first; raw patches are fallback context only.
- Force full re-analysis only when needed (e.g., reset cursor and rerun evolve).

## Critical: Never Edit Built-in Skills Directly

**NEVER modify any files inside built-in `aif-*` skill directories** (`skills/aif-*/`).
All files in these directories are owned by ai-factory and will be overwritten on update — any direct edits will be lost.

**ALWAYS write project-specific rules to skill-context:**
```
.ai-factory/skill-context/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

This is the ONLY correct target for built-in skill improvements. No exceptions.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Resolve Target & Load Context

#### Step 0.1: Resolve Target

**Normalize skill name from `$ARGUMENTS`:**

| User input         | Resolved skill name |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| `plan`             | `aif-plan`          |
| `aif-plan`         | `aif-plan`          |
| `/aif-plan`        | `aif-plan`          |
| `my-custom-skill`  | `my-custom-skill`   |

Rule: first, strip any leading `/` from the argument. Then: if the argument does not start with `aif-` AND a skill named `aif-<argument>` exists — use `aif-<argument>`. Otherwise use as-is.

**After resolving the skill name:** verify that the resolved skill actually exists
(check `.claude/skills/<resolved-name>/SKILL.md` or `skills/<resolved-name>/SKILL.md`).
If the skill is not found → report an error to the user and stop:
"Skill '<resolved-name>' not found. Use `/aif-evolve` without arguments to evolve
all skills, or specify a valid skill name."

**Determine which skills to evolve from `$ARGUMENTS`:**
- If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a specific skill name → evolve only that skill
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is "all" or empty → evolve all installed skills

#### Step 0.2: Load Context

**FIRST:** Read `.ai-factory/config.yaml` if it exists to resolve:
- **Paths:** `paths.description`, `paths.architecture`, `paths.rules_file`, `paths.rules`, `paths.patches`, and `paths.evolutions`
- **Language:** `language.ui` for prompts and `language.artifacts` for generated reports
- **Rules hierarchy:** `rules.base` plus any named `rules.<area>` entries

If config.yaml doesn't exist, use defaults:
- DESCRIPTION.md: `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md`
- ARCHITECTURE.md: `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- RULES.md: `.ai-factory/RULES.md`
- rules/: `.ai-factory/rules/`
- patches/: `.ai-factory/patches/`
- evolutions/: `.ai-factory/evolutions/`
- Language: `en` (English)

**Note:** `.ai-factory/skill-context/` remains a fixed internal AI Factory path in the current schema. Patch and evolution-log locations are configurable via `paths.patches` and `paths.evolutions`.

**THEN:** Read `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md` (use path from config) to understand:
- Tech stack
- Architecture
- Conventions

**Also read `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md`** (use path from config) and the configured rules hierarchy when present. This context informs convention analysis and gap detection but does not change artifact ownership.

**Read skill-context files for target skills:**

- If evolving a **specific skill** (e.g., `/aif-evolve plan`) → read only:
  1. `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-plan/SKILL.md` (target skill's context)
  2. `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-evolve/SKILL.md` (evolve's own context, if exists
     **and** target skill is not `aif-evolve` itself)
- If evolving **all skills** (`/aif-evolve` or `/aif-evolve all`) → read all context files:
  `Glob: .ai-factory/skill-context/*/SKILL.md` (this already includes evolve's own context — do NOT read it separately)

These contain previously accumulated project-specific rules for built-in skills.
Keep them in memory — they affect gap analysis in Step 5.

Skill-context rules are **project-level overrides** — when they conflict with the base SKILL.md of the target skill, skill-context wins (same principle as nested CLAUDE.md files).

**How to apply evolve's own skill-context rules (`aif-evolve`):**
- Treat them as **project-level overrides** for this skill's general instructions
- When a skill-context rule conflicts with a general rule written in this SKILL.md,
  **the skill-context rule wins** (more specific context takes priority — same principle as nested CLAUDE.md files)
- When there is no conflict, apply both: general rules from SKILL.md + project rules from skill-context
- Do NOT ignore skill-context rules even if they seem to contradict this skill's defaults —
  they exist because the project's experience proved the default insufficient
- **CRITICAL:** skill-context rules apply to ALL outputs of this skill — including the evolution
  report, proposed improvements, skill-context file edits, and stale rule analysis. If a
  skill-context rule says "evolve MUST prioritize X" or "report MUST include Y" — you MUST comply.
  Producing evolution output that ignores skill-context rules is a bug.

**Enforcement:** After generating any output artifact, verify it against all skill-context rules.
If any rule is violated — fix the output before presenting it to the user.

### Step 1: Collect Intelligence

**1.1: Read patches incrementally (cursor-based)**

```
Glob: <resolved patches dir>/*.md
```

Cursor file:

```
<resolved evolutions dir>/patch-cursor.json
```

Recommended shape:

```json
{
  "last_processed_patch": "YYYY-MM-DD-HH.mm.md",
  "updated_at": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm"
}
```

Processing rules:

1. Glob patch files and sort by filename ascending (timestamp format is lexical-friendly).
2. If no cursor file exists → first run: read all patches.
3. If cursor file exists and referenced patch is present → read only patches with filename `>` `last_processed_patch`.
4. If cursor file exists but referenced patch is missing (deleted/renamed) → emit `WARN [evolve]` and do a full rescan.
5. Historical edits/deletes for patches older than cursor are not reliably detectable without a saved baseline (snapshot/hash manifest). Do NOT emit this warning by default.
6. Emit `WARN [evolve]` for historical drift only when a reliable baseline exists and drift is actually detected.
7. Full rescan procedure: delete `<resolved evolutions dir>/patch-cursor.json`, then run `/aif-evolve` again.
8. **Do not advance cursor in Step 1.1.** Cursor is updated only after successful apply/log write in Step 7.3.

**Overlap window (anti-miss guard):**

LLMs may miss prevention points on a single pass. To reduce the chance of "permanently skipping" a patch when running incrementally:

9. When running in incremental mode (cursor exists and referenced patch is present), ALSO read the newest 5 patches by filename (tail-5 of the sorted patch list), then de-duplicate by filename.
10. Track these separately in your own notes:
   - "New patches" = patches with filename `>` `last_processed_patch`
   - "Overlap patches" = tail-5 patches
   - "Processed patches" = union(New, Overlap)
11. Cursor updates in Step 7.3 MUST be based on "New patches" only (never advance cursor when only overlap patches were processed).

Read every patch. For each one, extract:
- **Problem categories** (null-check, async, validation, types, API, DB, etc.)
- **Root cause patterns** (what classes of mistake were made)
- **Prevention points** — each independent actionable rule from the Prevention/Solution section.
  A single patch often contains **multiple independent prevention points targeting different skills**.
  Extract EACH one separately with its target skill(s). Do NOT treat a patch as a single unit.
- **Tags**

**Build a Prevention Point Registry** — a flat list of ALL extracted prevention points across
the processed patch set in this run. This registry is the primary input for Step 5 gap analysis.

```
| # | Patch | Prevention Point (specific action) | Target Skill(s) |
|---|-------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | <patch-file> | <concrete action to enforce> | <skill-1> |
| 2 | <patch-file> | <different action from same patch> | <skill-1>, <skill-2> |
| 3 | <other-patch> | <action> | <skill-3> |
```

**CRITICAL:** A patch with 5 prevention points produces 5 rows, not 1.
If a prevention point targets 2 skills, it appears once but with both skills listed —
and EACH skill must be checked independently in Step 5.

When the run is incremental, this registry reflects the processed patch set for this run (new + overlap). Use full rescan when you need full historical backfill.

**1.2: Aggregate patterns**

Group patches by tags and categories. Identify:
- **Recurring problems** — same tag appears 3+ times? This is a systemic issue
- **Tech-specific pitfalls** — problems tied to the stack (e.g., React re-renders, Laravel N+1)
- **Missing guards** — what checks/patterns could have prevented these bugs

**1.3: Read codebase conventions**

Scan the project for patterns:
- Linter configs (`.eslintrc`, `phpstan.neon`, `ruff.toml`, etc.)
- Existing test patterns (test file structure, assertions used)
- Error handling patterns (try/catch style, error types)
- Logging patterns (logger used, format, levels)
- Import conventions, file structure

**When evolving a specific skill**, focus convention scanning on areas relevant to that skill
(e.g., for `/aif-plan` — focus on file structure and naming; for `/aif-fix` — error handling and testing).

### Step 2: Read Target Skills

**Read ONLY the base SKILL.md files for target skills — not all skills.**

- If evolving a **specific skill** (e.g., `/aif-evolve plan`) → read only that one:
  `Read: .claude/skills/aif-plan/SKILL.md` (or `skills/aif-plan/SKILL.md` if not installed)
- If evolving **all skills** (`/aif-evolve` or `/aif-evolve all`) → read all:
  `Glob: .claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` (or `Glob: skills/*/SKILL.md` if not installed)

Keep loaded SKILL.md content in memory — Step 3 needs it for comparison (do NOT re-read).

### Step 3: Check for Stale Rules in Skill-Context

**When:** Run this step for every **target** `aif-*` skill that has a skill-context file.

**For each rule in `.ai-factory/skill-context/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`:**

**Scope constraint:** Step 3 can ONLY modify or remove skill-context files.
It must NEVER propose editing, deleting, or reverting base `skills/aif-*/` files.
Even if the base file contains errors or incomplete rules — that is outside evolve's scope.

1. Use the base `SKILL.md` already loaded in Step 2 (do NOT re-read the file).
2. Compare each skill-context rule against the base SKILL.md content:

   **Case A — Base fully covers skill-context rule (equivalent or superset):**
   The base SKILL.md now contains a rule that is equivalent to or MORE complete than
   the skill-context rule.
   This includes:
   - Exact equivalent — same rule, same content
   - Base is a superset — base has everything skill-context has, plus more
     (e.g., skill-context has Wave 1+3, base now has Wave 1+2+3)
   → Do NOT auto-remove. Do NOT ask the user yet.
   → Collect for the report in Step 4 — include both rules and mark as
     "Fully covered by base — recommend removing from skill-context".
   Note: if user chooses to keep the skill-context rule, this is valid —
   skill-context has priority over base, so keeping it acts as a guarantee
   that the complete/correct version is always applied.

   **Case B — Contradicting rule found in base SKILL.md:**
   The base skill now has a rule that directly contradicts the skill-context rule.
   → Do NOT auto-remove. Do NOT ask the user yet.
   → Collect this conflict for the report in Step 4 — include both rules and mark as "Conflict — user decision required".

   **Case C — Partial overlap (in either direction):**
   The base SKILL.md and skill-context rule overlap, but NEITHER fully covers the other.
   This includes:
   - Base covers part of skill-context, but skill-context has unique parts too
   - Skill-context covers part of base, but base has unique parts too
     (e.g., skill-context has A→B→C, base has A→C→D — both have unique parts)
   → Do NOT auto-narrow. Analyze whether parts depend on each other
     (ordering, prerequisites, data flow).
   → Collect this overlap for the report in Step 4 — include both rules, analysis, and mark as "Partial overlap — user decision required".
   **Priority warning:** skill-context has priority over base on the same topic.
   If user keeps skill-context as-is, the base's unique parts will likely be LOST
   (AI uses skill-context version, ignores base version of the same rule).
   Always explain this consequence in option descriptions.

   **Case D — No overlap:**
   The rule is still unique to the project context.
   → Keep as-is, no action needed.

### Step 4: Present & Resolve Stale Rules

**Skip this step** if no Case A/B/C rules were found in Step 3.

Present all stale rule findings using the stale rules report format
(Case A/B/C sections with base vs skill-context comparison).

**IMPORTANT: All decisions here affect ONLY skill-context files.**
Never propose editing, deleting, or reverting base `skills/aif-*/` files —
they are outside of evolve's scope.

#### Stale Rules Report Format

For each stale rule, present:

##### /aif-plan — Fully covered: [Rule Name]
- **Base SKILL.md says:** [base rule text]
- **Skill-context says:** [project rule text]
- **Decision required:** Keep in skill-context (has priority over base — ensures
  the complete version is always applied) / Remove from skill-context (trust base) /
  Rewrite skill-context rule

##### /aif-plan — Conflict: [Rule Name]
- **Base SKILL.md says:** [base rule text]
- **Skill-context says:** [project rule text]
- **Decision required:** Keep skill-context rule (has priority — base version will
  be ignored) / Remove skill-context rule (trust base) / Rewrite skill-context rule

##### /aif-fix — Partial overlap: [Rule Name]
- **Base SKILL.md says:** [base rule text]
- **Skill-context says:** [project rule text]
- **Analysis:** [explain overlap and whether parts are independent or sequential]
- **Decision required:** Rewrite skill-context to include both unique parts
  (recommended when parts are sequential) / Keep skill-context as-is (WARNING:
  base's unique parts will be lost — skill-context has priority) / Narrow
  skill-context to uncovered part / Remove from skill-context (trust base —
  skill-context's unique parts will be lost)

#### Collecting Decisions

Use `AskUserQuestion` to collect stale rule decisions. Process in batches
of up to 3 decisions per `AskUserQuestion` call:

- Present first batch (up to 3 stale rules) → `AskUserQuestion`
- Get answers → apply decisions
- If more stale rules remain → present next batch → `AskUserQuestion`
- Repeat until all stale rules are resolved

**Do NOT proceed to Step 5 until all stale rule decisions are collected
and applied.** This determines the actual skill-context state for gap analysis.

### Step 5: Analyze Gaps

**Before analyzing gaps:** re-read skill-context files for target skills that were
modified in Step 4 (stale rule removals/rewrites). Do NOT use the version loaded
in Step 0.2 — it is outdated after Step 4 changes.

For each skill, consider the base SKILL.md AND its **current** skill-context file
(after stale rule decisions from Step 4 have been applied).
A gap only exists if NEITHER source covers it.

For each skill, identify what's missing based on collected intelligence:

**5.1: Patch-driven gaps (prevention-point-exhaustive)**

**CRITICAL: Check each prevention point × each target skill independently.**

Iterate over the Prevention Point Registry built in Step 1.1. For each row:
1. For EACH target skill listed in that row:
   - Check if the base SKILL.md already covers this **specific** prevention action
   - Check if the skill-context already has a rule covering this **specific** prevention action
2. A prevention point is "covered" for a skill ONLY when there is a rule that addresses
   the **specific action described** — not merely when the same patch filename appears in
   a Source field.
3. Mark uncovered (prevention_point, skill) pairs as gaps → these become inputs for Step 6.

**Common trap — Source reference ≠ full coverage:**
Finding `Source: <patch-filename>` in a skill-context rule means ONE rule was derived
from that patch. It does **NOT** mean ALL prevention points from that patch are covered.
A patch with 5 prevention points may have only 1 covered. Always verify the **content**
of the existing rule against each prevention point individually.

**Verification:** After completing the registry scan, count: total prevention points,
covered, uncovered. If uncovered > 0 — these are gaps for Step 6.

Note: in incremental mode, counts represent this run's processed patch set. For full historical recount, run a full rescan.

**5.2: Tech-stack gaps**

Compare project tech stack against skill instructions:
- Skills reference generic patterns but project uses specific framework? → Add framework-specific guidance
- Project uses TypeScript but skills show JS examples? → Update examples
- Project uses specific ORM (Prisma, Eloquent)? → Add ORM-specific patterns

**5.3: Convention gaps**

Compare project conventions against skill instructions:
- Project has specific error handling pattern? → Skills should enforce it
- Project uses specific logger? → Skills should reference it
- Project has specific file structure? → Skills should follow it

### Step 6: Generate Improvements

For each gap found, create a concrete improvement:

**Quality rules for improvements:**
- **One prevention point = one rule.** A single patch may contain multiple independent prevention
  items. Each one becomes a separate rule — do NOT merge them into a single vague summary.
- **Preserve concrete formats and patterns** from patches. If a patch specifies an exact format,
  syntax, or template — the rule MUST include it verbatim. Do NOT paraphrase specifics into
  vague descriptions.
- Each improvement must be traceable to a patch, convention, or tech-stack fact
- No generic advice — only project-specific enhancements
- Improvements must be minimal and focused — don't rewrite entire skills
- Preserve existing skill structure — add, don't replace

### Step 7: Present & Apply

**7.1: Present improvements to user**

Each improvement MUST explicitly state the target file path.
Use the following target labels:

- **`skill-context`** → `.ai-factory/skill-context/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- **`SKILL.md`** → direct edit of the skill's own `SKILL.md` (only for custom/non-aif skills)
- **Nested file** → if the skill directory contains additional files (e.g., `templates/`, `checklists/`),
  specify the exact relative path within the skill directory

Format:

```
## Skill Evolution Report

Based on:
- X patches analyzed
- Y recurring patterns found
- Z tech-stack specific insights

### Proposed Improvements

#### /aif-fix (N rules)
**Target:** `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-fix/SKILL.md`

1. **Add null-check guard**
   - **Source:** patch-2026-02-10.md, patch-2026-02-12.md (5 patches involved null references)
   - **Why:** Recurring null-reference errors on optional DB relations
   - **Rule:** "Check for optional/nullable fields before accessing nested properties"

2. **Add async/await pattern**
   - **Source:** patch-2026-02-11.md (3 patches involved unhandled promises)
   - **Why:** Unhandled promise rejections in API layer
   - **Rule:** "Always use try/catch with async/await"

#### /aif-implement (N rules)
**Target:** `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-implement/SKILL.md`

1. **Add Prisma-specific warning**
   - **Source:** patch-2026-02-13.md (2 patches from incorrect Prisma queries)
   - **Why:** Silent data loss from wrong Prisma query methods
   - **Rule:** "Log all Prisma queries in DEBUG mode"

#### /my-custom-skill (N rules)
**Target:** `skills/my-custom-skill/SKILL.md` (direct edit — custom skill)

1. **Add pattern**
   - **Source:** codebase convention
   - **Why:** Missing guard in Step 2
   - **Rule:** "..."
```

**After presenting the full report, use `AskUserQuestion` to collect decisions:**

For improvements — ask:
- Yes, apply all improvements
- Let me pick
- No, just save report (no changes applied)

**Based on choice:**
- "Yes, apply all improvements" → proceed to 7.2 with all improvements
- "Let me pick" → present improvements in batches of up to 4
  per `AskUserQuestion` call (same approach as Step 4 stale rules). For each
  improvement, options: Apply / Skip. Continue until all improvements are resolved.
  Then proceed to 7.2 with only approved improvements.
- "No, just save report" → no changes applied, **STOP**

**Do NOT apply any changes until the user answers.**

**7.2: Apply approved improvements**

For each approved improvement, determine the target:

**If the skill is a built-in `aif-*` skill** (its SKILL.md is inside the package `skills/` directory):

1. Create directory if needed:
   mkdir -p .ai-factory/skill-context/<skill-name>
2. If `.ai-factory/skill-context/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` doesn't exist — create it with the header template
3. If it exists — read it first, then for each improvement decide:
   - **Update existing rule** — when a rule on the same topic already exists (e.g., a null-check rule
     exists from 3 patches, and 5 new null-check patches arrived → strengthen the existing rule,
     update its Source list, adjust severity/wording based on new evidence)
   - **Add new rule** — when no existing rule covers this topic
   - **Merge rules** — when multiple narrow rules can be combined into one broader rule
     (e.g., three separate "check field X" rules → one "always null-check optional DB relations" rule)
4. Update the `> Last updated:` and `> Based on:` lines in the header
5. **NEVER edit any files inside the skill's `skills/aif-*/` directory** — all files there are owned by ai-factory and WILL be overwritten on update. All improvements go to skill-context only.
6. After applying all changes (including stale rule removals), if a skill-context file has no rules left
   (only the header remains), delete the file and its directory:
   `rm .ai-factory/skill-context/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
   `rmdir .ai-factory/skill-context/<skill-name>` (only if empty)
7. Update the `> Based on:` count and `> Last updated:` in skill-context files that were
   only affected by stale rule removals (Step 4) but did NOT receive new improvements
   (those were already updated in item 4).

**If the skill is a custom/project skill** (not `aif-*`):
1. Edit the skill's `SKILL.md` directly (existing behavior, unchanged)

**Context file template:**

**IMPORTANT: All skill-context files MUST be written in English**, regardless of the user's language or the language used in patches/RULES.md. Skill-context rules are consumed by AI agents — English ensures consistent interpretation across all skills and sessions.

```
# Project Rules for /<skill-name>

> Auto-generated by `/aif-evolve`. Do not edit manually.
> Last updated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
> Based on: N analyzed patches

## Rules

### [Rule Name]
**Source**: [patch filenames or "codebase convention"]
**Rule**: [Specific, actionable instruction in English]
```

**7.3: Save evolution log**

Create `<resolved evolutions dir>/YYYY-MM-DD-HH.mm.md`:

```bash
mkdir -p <resolved evolutions dir>
```

After saving the evolution log, update cursor state:

Definitions:
- "New patches processed" = patches with filename `>` `last_processed_patch`.
  - If no cursor exists (first run): "New patches" is the full patch list.
  - Overlap patches do NOT count as "New patches".
- "Improvements applied" = at least one approved improvement was written to disk
  (skill-context updated and/or custom skill SKILL.md edited).

Cursor update rules:

1. If no new patches were processed, keep cursor unchanged.
2. If new patches were processed:
   - If improvements were applied: advance the cursor to the newest "New patch" filename.
   - If no improvements were applied (e.g., user chose "No, just save report" or skipped all):
     - Do NOT advance cursor by default.
     - Ask the user whether to advance cursor anyway.
       - Recommended: keep cursor unchanged to allow reruns (LLMs may miss prevention points).
       - If the user explicitly chooses to advance anyway, write the cursor as usual.
3. If execution fails before changes are finalized, do not advance cursor.

# Evolution: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm

## Intelligence Summary
- Patches analyzed: X
- Recurring patterns: [list]
- Tech stack: [from DESCRIPTION.md]

## Improvements Applied

### [skill-name] → skill-context
- [change description] ← driven by patches: [patch filenames]
  **File:** `.ai-factory/skill-context/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`

### [skill-name] → SKILL.md (custom skill)
- [change description] ← driven by: [tech stack / convention]
  **File:** `skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md`

## Patterns Identified
- [pattern]: [frequency] occurrences
- [pattern]: [frequency] occurrences
```

### Step 8: Suggest Next Actions

```
## Evolution Complete

Skills improved: X
Improvements applied: Y

### Recommendations

1. **Run `/aif-review`** on recent code to verify improvements
2. **Next evolution** — run `/aif-evolve` again after 5-10 more fixes
3. **Consider new skill** — if pattern X keeps recurring, create a dedicated skill:
   `/aif-skill-generator <skill-name>`
```

### Context Cleanup

## Artifact Ownership

- Primary ownership: `.ai-factory/skill-context/*`, `<resolved evolutions dir>/*.md`, and `<resolved evolutions dir>/patch-cursor.json`.
- Config use is partial here: `config.yaml` resolves description, rules, patches, and evolution-log paths, but skill-context remains a fixed AI Factory internal path.
- Read-only context: roadmap, rules, research, and plan artifacts unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.

After completing evolution, suggest `/clear` or `/compact` — context is heavy after patch analysis and skill processing.

## Rules

1. **Traceable** — every improvement must link to a patch, convention, or tech fact
2. **Minimal** — add rules to skill-context, don't rewrite base skills
3. **Reversible** — user approves before changes are applied
4. **Cumulative** — each evolution builds on previous ones
5. **No hallucination** — only suggest improvements backed by evidence
6. **Preserve structure** — don't change base skill workflow, only enrich via skill-context
7. **Skill-context only** — all improvements for built-in `aif-*` skills go to `.ai-factory/skill-context/`, never to `skills/aif-*/`. **NEVER edit any files inside `skills/aif-*/`** — they are overwritten on update. No exceptions.
8. **English only** — all skill-context files must be written in English, regardless of user's language
9. **No generic advice** — "write clean code" is not an improvement; only project-specific enhancements
10. **No new skills** — suggest `/aif-skill-generator` instead
11. **No losing coverage** — do not remove rules unless they are stale (Steps 3-4).
    Merges in Step 7 (combining narrow rules into a broader one) are allowed as long
    as all prevention points are preserved in the merged rule.
12. **Installed only** — do not evolve skills not installed in the project
13. **Ownership boundary** — this command owns `<resolved evolutions dir>/*.md`, `<resolved evolutions dir>/patch-cursor.json`, and `.ai-factory/skill-context/*`; treat roadmap/rules/research/plan artifacts as read-only context unless explicitly asked

## Example

```
/aif-evolve fix

→ Found 6/10 patches tagged #null-check
→ Improvement for /aif-fix (2 rules):
  Target: .ai-factory/skill-context/aif-fix/SKILL.md
  1. "PRIORITY CHECK: Look for optional/nullable fields accessed
      without null guards. This is the #1 source of bugs in this project."
  2. "When fixing nullable relation errors, check ALL usages of that
      relation in the same file — same bug often repeats nearby."
```
