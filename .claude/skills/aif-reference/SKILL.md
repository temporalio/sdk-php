# Reference Creator

Create structured knowledge references from external sources and store them in the configured references directory so other AI Factory skills can reuse them later.

## Step 0: Load Config

**FIRST:** Read `.ai-factory/config.yaml` if it exists to resolve:
- **Paths:** `paths.references` and `paths.rules_file`
- **Language:** `language.ui` for prompts and summaries, `language.artifacts` for generated reference artifacts, and `language.technical_terms` for human-readable technical terminology in references

If config.yaml doesn't exist, use defaults:
- references/: `.ai-factory/references/`
- RULES.md: `.ai-factory/RULES.md`
- `ui_language`: `en`
- `artifact_language`: `en`
- `technical_terms_policy`: `keep`

Resolved language values:
- `ui_language = language.ui || "en"`
- `artifact_language = language.artifacts || language.ui || "en"`
- `technical_terms_policy = language.technical_terms || "keep"`

If `technical_terms_policy` is not one of `keep`, `translate`, or `mixed`, treat it as `keep`. Legacy values such as `english` also behave like `keep`.

All AskUserQuestion prompts, progress updates, summaries, and next-step guidance MUST be written in `ui_language`.

Generated reference files and the reference `INDEX.md` MUST be written in `artifact_language`.

Templates and examples define structure, not fixed English output. If `artifact_language` is not `en`, translate human-readable headings, labels, summaries, concept explanations, best-practice prose, pitfalls, and index descriptions before saving. Preserve source quotations, source titles, URLs, local paths, code examples, API signatures, command names, config keys, package names, version strings, raw errors, and link targets unchanged. Apply `technical_terms_policy` to other human-readable terminology.

### Project Context

**Read `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-reference/SKILL.md`** - MANDATORY if the file exists.

This file contains project-specific rules accumulated by `/aif-evolve` from patches,
codebase conventions, and tech-stack analysis. These rules are tailored to the current project.

**How to apply skill-context rules:**
- Treat them as **project-level overrides** for this skill's general instructions
- When a skill-context rule conflicts with a general rule written in this SKILL.md,
  **the skill-context rule wins**
- When there is no conflict, apply both
- **CRITICAL:** skill-context rules apply to ALL outputs of this skill - including the generated
  reference files. If a skill-context rule says "references MUST include X" - you MUST comply.

**Enforcement:** After generating any output artifact, verify it against all skill-context rules.
If any rule is violated - fix the output before presenting it to the user.

## When To Use

- AI needs documentation it was not trained on or may know only partially
- You want grounded answers based on specific docs, specs, or internal files
- You want reusable domain context for `/aif-plan`, `/aif-implement`, `/aif-explore`, or `/aif-grounded`
- You want a durable knowledge artifact instead of one-off conversation context

## Argument Detection

```text
Check $ARGUMENTS:
- Contains "--update"        -> Update Mode: refresh existing reference
- Contains URLs (http/https) -> URL Mode: fetch and process web sources
- Contains file paths        -> File Mode: process local documents
- "list"                     -> List existing references
- "show <name>"              -> Show reference content
- "delete <name>"            -> Delete a reference (with confirmation)
- Empty                      -> Interactive mode
```

## Workflow

### Step 0.1: Setup

Ensure the resolved references directory exists:

```bash
mkdir -p <resolved references dir>
```

Check for existing references to avoid duplicates:

```bash
ls <resolved references dir>
```

If `--name <ref-name>` is provided, use it as the reference name.
If `--update` is provided, find and update the existing reference instead of creating a new one.

### Step 1: Collect Sources

**For URLs:**

For each URL:

1. Fetch the page using `WebFetch` and extract:
   - main topic and purpose
   - key concepts, terms, and definitions
   - code examples and patterns
   - API methods, parameters, return types, and signatures
   - configuration options with defaults
   - best practices and recommendations
   - error handling and edge cases
   - version information and compatibility notes
   - links to critical sub-pages
2. If critical sub-pages are referenced, fetch them too (up to 8 extra pages per source URL).
3. If obvious gaps remain, run 1-2 targeted `WebSearch` queries to fill them.

**For local files:**

1. Read each file with `Read`
2. If the file references other local files, read those too (up to 5 levels of includes)
3. Detect the format (markdown, HTML, JSON, YAML, plain text) and extract accordingly

**For interactive mode:**

Ask the user:
1. What topic or technology should this reference cover?
2. Do they have URLs or local files, or should you search?
3. What aspects matter most for their use case?

### Step 2: Synthesize the Reference

Transform collected material into a structured reference document.

**Reference file format:**

Render this structure in `artifact_language` before saving. The headings below are canonical structure labels, not fixed English output.

```markdown
# <Topic> Reference

> Source: <list of source URLs or file paths>
> Created: YYYY-MM-DD
> Updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

<1-3 paragraph summary>

## Core Concepts

<Concept 1>: <clear explanation>
<Concept 2>: <clear explanation>

## API / Interface

<Only if applicable. Preserve exact signatures and types from source docs.>

## Usage Patterns

<Practical code examples organized by use case.>

## Configuration

<Options, defaults, valid values. Table format preferred.>

## Best Practices

<Numbered list with reasoning>

## Common Pitfalls

<What goes wrong and how to avoid it>

## Version Notes

<Only if relevant. Breaking changes, migration notes, deprecations.>
```

**Quality rules:**
- **No hallucination** - include only what was actually found
- **Preserve code verbatim** - docs examples must stay exact
- **Actionable over academic** - optimize for useful lookup
- **Dense** - maximize useful information per line
- **Complete signatures** - APIs need full parameters, types, and returns
- **Source attribution** - always include source URLs or paths

### Step 3: Name and Save

**Naming convention:**
- Derive from topic: `react-hooks.md`, `fastapi-endpoints.md`, `docker-compose.md`
- Use lowercase, hyphens, `.md`
- If `--name` was provided, use that (add `.md` if missing)
- Avoid generic names like `reference.md`

**Save to:** `<resolved references dir>/<name>.md`

### Step 4: Register in Index

Check if `<resolved references dir>/INDEX.md` exists. Create or update it:

Write human-readable index headings, topic descriptions, and source summaries in `artifact_language`; keep filenames, links, URLs, and dates unchanged.

```markdown
# References Index

Available knowledge references for AI agents.

| Reference | Topic | Sources | Updated |
|-----------|-------|---------|---------|
| [react-hooks](react-hooks.md) | React Hooks API and patterns | react.dev | 2026-03-20 |
| [docker-compose](docker-compose.md) | Docker Compose configuration | docs.docker.com | 2026-03-20 |
```

### Step 5: Report

Show the user:
- reference name and path
- size (line count)
- sections included
- source URLs or file paths used
- how to use it in later AI Factory workflows

## Update Mode (`--update`)

When `--update` is present:

1. Find the existing reference by `--name` or matching sources
2. Re-fetch the sources listed in the header
3. Compare new material with existing content and update only changed sections
4. Preserve `Created:`, update `Updated:`
5. Report what changed

## List / Show / Delete

- **`/aif-reference list`** - read and display `<resolved references dir>/INDEX.md` or list files in the directory
- **`/aif-reference show <name>`** - read and display the reference content (`.md` is optional)
- **`/aif-reference delete <name>`** - ask for confirmation, delete the file, and update `INDEX.md`

## Integration With Other Skills

References in the resolved references directory are available to all AI Factory skills:
- `/aif-plan` and `/aif-implement` can read them for domain context
- `/aif-grounded` can use them as evidence sources
- `/aif-explore` can reference them during research

To make a skill aware of a specific reference, mention it in the resolved RULES.md file:

```markdown
## References
- For <topic> details, see `<resolved references dir>/<name>.md`
```

## Artifact Ownership

- **Primary ownership:** the resolved references directory (default: `.ai-factory/references/`)
- **Shared ownership:** the resolved references index file (`INDEX.md` inside that directory)
- **Read-only:** all other `.ai-factory/` files
- **Config policy:** config-aware. Use `paths.references` for storage, `paths.rules_file` when pointing other skills at a saved reference, `language.ui` for prompts and summaries, `language.artifacts` for generated reference artifacts, and `language.technical_terms` for human-readable terminology policy.

## Guardrails

- **Max reference size:** aim for under 1000 lines per reference. If larger, split into multiple files and create a directory inside the resolved references dir with an `INDEX.md` inside
- **No duplication:** check existing references before creating a new one
- **No stale data:** always include sources so the reference can be refreshed
- **No opinions:** references should reflect sources, not personal preferences
- **Respect access:** if a URL requires authentication or fails to load, report that instead of guessing
