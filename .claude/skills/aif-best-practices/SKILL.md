# Best Practices Guide

Universal code quality guidelines applicable to any language or framework.

**Context:** If `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md` exists, follow its folder structure, dependency rules, and module boundaries alongside these guidelines.

**Read `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-best-practices/SKILL.md`** — MANDATORY if the file exists.

This file contains project-specific rules accumulated by `/aif-evolve` from patches,
codebase conventions, and tech-stack analysis. These rules are tailored to the current project.

**How to apply skill-context rules:**
- Treat them as **project-level overrides** for this skill's general instructions
- When a skill-context rule conflicts with a general rule written in this SKILL.md,
  **the skill-context rule wins** (more specific context takes priority — same principle as nested CLAUDE.md files)
- When there is no conflict, apply both: general rules from SKILL.md + project rules from skill-context
- Do NOT ignore skill-context rules even if they seem to contradict this skill's defaults —
  they exist because the project's experience proved the default insufficient
- **CRITICAL:** skill-context rules apply to ALL outputs of this skill — including the
  recommendations, examples, and checklists you present. If a skill-context rule says "best practices
  MUST prioritize X" or "examples MUST follow convention Y" — you MUST comply. Presenting guidance
  that contradicts skill-context rules is a bug.

**Enforcement:** After generating any output artifact, verify it against all skill-context rules.
If any rule is violated — fix the output before presenting it to the user.

## Naming Conventions

### Variables & Functions
```
✅ Good                          ❌ Bad
─────────────────────────────────────────────
getUserById(id)                  getUser(i)
isValidEmail                     checkEmail
maxRetryCount                    max
calculateTotalPrice              calc
handleSubmit                     submit
```

**Rules:**
- Use descriptive names that reveal intent
- Avoid abbreviations (except universally known: `id`, `url`, `api`)
- Boolean variables: `is`, `has`, `can`, `should` prefix
- Functions: verb + noun (`fetchUser`, `validateInput`)
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Classes/Types: PascalCase
- Variables/functions: camelCase (JS/TS/PHP) or snake_case (Python/Rust)

### Files & Directories
```
✅ Good                          ❌ Bad
─────────────────────────────────────────────
user-service.ts                  userService.ts (inconsistent)
UserRepository.ts                user_repository.ts (mixed)
/components/Button/              /Components/button/
/services/auth/                  /Services/Auth/
```

**Rules:**
- One convention per project (kebab-case or PascalCase for files)
- Directories: lowercase with hyphens
- Test files: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts` (consistent)
- Index files: only for re-exports, not logic

## Code Structure

### Function Design
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Single responsibility, clear inputs/outputs
function calculateDiscount(price: number, discountPercent: number): number {
  if (discountPercent < 0 || discountPercent > 100) {
    throw new Error('Discount must be between 0 and 100');
  }
  return price * (1 - discountPercent / 100);
}

// ❌ Bad: Multiple responsibilities, side effects
function processOrder(order) {
  validateOrder(order);           // validation
  order.discount = getDiscount(); // mutation
  saveToDatabase(order);          // persistence
  sendEmail(order.user);          // notification
  return order;
}
```

```php
// ✅ Good: PHP with type declarations
function calculateDiscount(float $price, float $discountPercent): float
{
    if ($discountPercent < 0 || $discountPercent > 100) {
        throw new InvalidArgumentException('Discount must be between 0 and 100');
    }
    return $price * (1 - $discountPercent / 100);
}
```

**Rules:**
- Single Responsibility: one function = one job
- Max 20-30 lines per function
- Max 3-4 parameters (use object for more)
- No side effects in pure functions
- Early returns for guard clauses

### Module Organization
```
feature/
├── index.ts          # Public exports only
├── types.ts          # Types and interfaces
├── constants.ts      # Constants
├── utils.ts          # Pure utility functions
├── hooks.ts          # React hooks (if applicable)
├── service.ts        # Business logic
└── repository.ts     # Data access
```

**Rules:**
- Group by feature, not by type
- Clear public API via index.ts
- Internal modules prefixed with `_` or in `internal/`
- Avoid circular dependencies

## Error Handling

### Do's and Don'ts
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Specific errors, meaningful messages
class UserNotFoundError extends Error {
  constructor(userId: string) {
    super(`User not found: ${userId}`);
    this.name = 'UserNotFoundError';
  }
}

async function getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
  const user = await db.users.find(id);
  if (!user) {
    throw new UserNotFoundError(id);
  }
  return user;
}

// ❌ Bad: Generic errors, swallowed exceptions
async function getUser(id) {
  try {
    return await db.users.find(id);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);  // Swallowed!
    return null;     // Hides the problem
  }
}
```

**Rules:**
- Create specific error classes for domain errors
- Never swallow exceptions without logging
- Log errors with context (user ID, request ID, etc.)
- Use error boundaries at system edges
- Return Result types for expected failures (optional)

### Error Messages
```
✅ Good: "Failed to create user: email 'test@example.com' already exists"
❌ Bad: "Error occurred"
❌ Bad: "Something went wrong"
```

---

## Testing Practices

### Test Structure (AAA Pattern)
```typescript
describe('calculateDiscount', () => {
  it('should apply percentage discount to price', () => {
    // Arrange
    const price = 100;
    const discount = 20;

    // Act
    const result = calculateDiscount(price, discount);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(80);
  });

  it('should throw for invalid discount percentage', () => {
    expect(() => calculateDiscount(100, -10)).toThrow();
    expect(() => calculateDiscount(100, 150)).toThrow();
  });
});
```

**Rules:**
- One assertion concept per test
- Descriptive test names: "should [expected behavior] when [condition]"
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use factories/fixtures for test data
- Avoid testing private methods directly

### Test Coverage Priorities
```
1. Critical business logic      ████████████ Must have
2. Edge cases and boundaries    ████████░░░░ Important
3. Integration points           ██████░░░░░░ Important
4. Happy paths                  ████░░░░░░░░ Basic
5. UI components                ██░░░░░░░░░░ Optional
```

## Code Review Checklist

### Before Requesting Review
- [ ] Self-reviewed the diff
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] No debug code (console.log, debugger)
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] Updated documentation if needed
- [ ] Commit messages are clear

### Reviewer Checklist
- [ ] **Correctness**: Does it do what it claims?
- [ ] **Edge cases**: What could go wrong?
- [ ] **Security**: Any vulnerabilities? (see `/aif-security-checklist`)
- [ ] **Performance**: Any obvious bottlenecks?
- [ ] **Readability**: Can I understand it in 5 minutes?
- [ ] **Tests**: Are critical paths covered?
- [ ] **Consistency**: Follows project conventions?

### Review Comments
```
✅ Good feedback:
"This could throw if `user` is null. Consider adding a null check
or using optional chaining: `user?.profile?.name`"

❌ Bad feedback:
"This is wrong"
"I don't like this"
"Why did you do it this way?"
```

## Quick Rules Summary

| Area | Rule |
|------|------|
| Naming | Descriptive, consistent, reveals intent |
| Functions | Small, single purpose, no side effects |
| Errors | Specific types, never swallow, log context |
| Tests | AAA pattern, test behavior, descriptive names |
| Reviews | Be specific, suggest solutions, be kind |

## Artifact Ownership and Config Policy

- Primary ownership: none. This skill is advisory and reference-only.
- Write policy: do not create or modify project artifacts by default.
- Config policy: config-agnostic by design. Follow repository context, `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and skill-context overrides instead of reading `config.yaml`.
