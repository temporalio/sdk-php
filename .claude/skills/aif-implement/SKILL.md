# Implement - Execute Task Plan

Execute tasks from the plan, track progress, and enable session continuation.

## Workflow

### Step 0 (pre): Detect Handoff Mode

Determine Handoff mode. If the caller passed `HANDOFF_MODE` and `HANDOFF_SKIP_REVIEW` as explicit text in the prompt, use those values. Otherwise, use the Bash tool:

```
Bash: printenv HANDOFF_MODE || true
Bash: printenv HANDOFF_SKIP_REVIEW || true
```

**Then check `HANDOFF_MODE`:**

#### When `HANDOFF_MODE` is `1` (autonomous Handoff agent)

The Handoff coordinator already manages status transitions and DB writes directly. Do NOT call MCP tools. Instead:

- **No interactive questions:** Do not use `AskUserQuestion` — use sensible defaults (auto-commit at checkpoints, skip pause prompts).
- **No pause/resume prompts:** Execute all tasks sequentially without stopping.

#### When `HANDOFF_MODE` is NOT `1` (manual Claude Code session)

Handoff sync is handled inline — see **Step 0.2** (after reading the plan file) for the task ID extraction and MCP sync trigger. The sync points are:

- **On start (Step 0.2):** `handoff_sync_status` → `"implementing"` (with `paused: true`)
- **On checklist update (Step 3.6):** `handoff_push_plan` with updated plan content
- **On completion (Step 5):** `handoff_push_plan` with final plan, then `handoff_sync_status` → `"review"` (with `paused: true`) or `"done"` (with `paused: false` when `HANDOFF_SKIP_REVIEW=1`)

**CRITICAL:** Always pass `paused: true` with every `handoff_sync_status` call except `done`. This prevents the autonomous Handoff agent from picking up the task while you work manually. Only `done` passes `paused: false`.

### Step 0: Check Current State

**FIRST:** Determine what state we're in:

```
1. Read `.ai-factory/config.yaml` if it exists to resolve:
   - `paths.description`, `paths.architecture`, `paths.rules_file`, `paths.roadmap`, `paths.research`
   - `paths.plan`, `paths.plans`, `paths.fix_plan`, `paths.patches`
   - `paths.archive`
   - `paths.rules`
   - `language.ui`, `language.artifacts`
   - `git.enabled`, `git.base_branch`, `git.create_branches`
   - `workflow.plan_id_format` (default: `slug`) — used by branch-based plan discovery.
     Active values: `slug` and `sequential`. When `sequential`, the resolver
     globs `<paths.plans>/[0-9]{4}_<branch-slug>.md` first and falls back to
     `<paths.plans>/<branch-slug>.md` only if no numbered match is found.
     `timestamp` and `uuid` are **reserved values** and currently behave like `slug`.
     Treat any unknown value as `slug`.
   - `rules.base` plus any named `rules.<area>` entries
2. Parse arguments:
   - --list → list available plans only (no implementation; STOP)
   - --without-plan <description> → inline implementation mode; skip plan discovery and jump to Step 0.inline
   - @<path> → explicit plan file override (highest priority)
   - <number> → start from specific task
   - status → status-only mode
   - Optional inline-mode flag: --docs=yes|no|warn (only valid with --without-plan; default: warn)
3. If `git.enabled = true`, check for uncommitted changes (`git status`)
4. If `git.enabled = true`, check current branch
```

### Step 0.list: List Available Plans (`--list`)

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--list`, run read-only plan discovery and stop.

```
1. Get current branch:
   git branch --show-current (git mode only)
2. Convert branch to filename: replace "/" with "-", add ".md" (git mode only)
3. Check existence of:
   - <configured plans dir>/<branch-name>.md (git mode only, default `plan_id_format`)
   - when `workflow.plan_id_format = sequential`: also glob
     `<configured plans dir>/[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]_<branch-name-without-.md>.md`;
     report all matches (highest-numbered first)
   - if git mode is off or branch creation is disabled: any `*.md` full-mode plan in `<configured plans dir>/`
   - <resolved fast plan path>
   - <resolved fix plan path>
4. Print plan availability summary and usage hints
5. STOP.
```

**Important:** In `--list` mode:

- Do not execute tasks
- Do not modify files
- Do not update TaskList statuses

For detailed output format and examples, see:

- `skills/aif-implement/references/IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` → "List Available Plans (`--list`)"

### Step 0.inline: Inline Implementation Mode (`--without-plan`)

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--without-plan`, execute a single scoped task from the description WITHOUT creating or reading any plan file. This is the lightweight path for small `feat`/`chore` tasks that do not justify a full plan but are not bug fixes either (use `/aif-fix` for bugs).

**Argument parsing:**

```
1. description = everything after `--without-plan`, excluding any recognized flag tokens (`--docs=...`).
2. docs_policy = value of `--docs=yes|no|warn` if present, else `warn` (default).
3. Validation:
   - description is empty →
     ERROR: "Usage: /aif-implement --without-plan <description> [--docs=yes|no|warn]"
     → STOP
   - arguments also contain `@<path>`, `status`, or a bare task id number →
     ERROR: "`--without-plan` is mutually exclusive with @plan-file, status, and task id."
     → STOP
   - `--docs=<value>` where <value> not in {yes, no, warn} →
     ERROR: "Invalid --docs value. Expected yes|no|warn."
     → STOP
```

**Scope guard (prevent silent mega-tasks):**

Before executing, assess the description. If it looks too broad for a one-shot inline task — multiple unrelated imperatives joined by "and"/"и", references to multiple subsystems, or roughly more than ~300 characters of scope — do NOT attempt to guess a plan. Instead print:

```
Description looks too broad for inline implementation. Recommended:
  /aif-plan fast <description>
```

→ STOP.

Small, focused descriptions (e.g. "add GET /healthz returning 200 with {status:\"ok\"}") proceed.

**Surprise-warn on existing plan artifacts (non-blocking):**

Inline mode ignores plan files by design. If any of these exist on disk, emit a `WARN [inline]` line so the user notices the intentional skip (do NOT read them, do NOT redirect):

- `<configured plans dir>/<branch>.md` (git mode only) — or
  `<configured plans dir>/[0-9]{4}_<branch>.md` when `workflow.plan_id_format = sequential`
- resolved fast plan path (`paths.plan`)
- resolved fix plan path (`paths.fix_plan`)

Example: `WARN [inline] paths.plan exists but is ignored in --without-plan mode.`

**Load project context (same as regular implement):**

Use the resolved config from Step 0:

- `paths.description` (DESCRIPTION.md) if present
- `paths.architecture` (ARCHITECTURE.md) if present
- `paths.rules_file` (RULES.md) + `rules.base` + named `rules.<area>` entries
- `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-implement/SKILL.md` — MANDATORY if the file exists (same precedence and enforcement as regular mode in Step 0.1)
- `language.ui`, `language.artifacts`

**Plan artifact policy:** inline mode does NOT load or use plan/fix-plan files. Plan files are never read, parsed, or executed. A minimal existence probe is permitted (see the surprise-warn section above) solely to emit the `WARN [inline]` line — nothing is read from disk. Also skip: resume/recovery reconciliation, TaskList loading, checkbox state comparison.

**Execute the task (one-shot):**

1. Announce: `Inline implementation: <description>`
2. Read only files relevant to the described scope
3. Apply changes following existing code patterns and skill-context rules
4. Apply verbose logging per `references/LOGGING-GUIDE.md`
5. Do not add tests by default. Add them only if the description explicitly requests tests (e.g. "with tests", "add tests for X") OR if existing project conventions / touched code paths clearly require them (e.g. a test file mirrors every source file in the area being changed, or a RULES.md / skill-context rule mandates test coverage for this kind of change). When in doubt, prefer NO tests and let the user follow up via `/aif-plan` if wider test coverage is needed.
6. Verify the change compiles/runs and the described behavior works

**Prohibited in inline mode:**

- Do NOT create or read `paths.plan` / `paths.plans/*` / `paths.fix_plan`.
- Do NOT invoke `/aif-plan` or `/aif-fix`.
- Do NOT create entries under `paths.patches` (no `[FIX]` self-improvement patch — this is not a bugfix flow).
- Do NOT call `TaskList` / `TaskGet` / `TaskUpdate` (no plan = no persisted tasks).
- Do NOT search for or modify plan checkboxes on disk.
- Do NOT trigger the roadmap milestone completion check, docs checkpoint-from-plan-setting, plan-file cleanup prompt, or worktree merge prompt (those belong to the plan-backed workflow).

**Handoff inline support:**

> Naming clarification: `--without-plan` means "without a **local** plan artifact on disk" (no `paths.plan` / `paths.plans/*` / `paths.fix_plan`). When a Handoff task is linked, the task is still represented as a synthetic plan **inside Handoff** via `handoff_push_plan` — that's a remote representation, not a local file. The local-no-plan contract is preserved; only the remote sync surface is unchanged.

**When `HANDOFF_MODE` is `1` (autonomous Handoff agent invoked inline mode):**

- Do NOT call any `mcp__handoff__*` tool (the coordinator manages status/sync directly — same rule as Step 0 (pre)).
- Do NOT create local plan artifacts (the regular Prohibited list above still applies).
- Do NOT switch branches, create worktrees, merge worktrees, or otherwise alter the branch/worktree the coordinator set up — inline mode operates on the working tree it was invoked in.
- Proceed with the one-shot execution; the coordinator marks the task complete after the skill returns.

**When `HANDOFF_MODE` is NOT `1` and `HANDOFF_TASK_ID` is set (manual Claude Code session linked to a Handoff task):**

1. Build synthetic plan content:

   ```markdown
   # Inline implementation
   - [ ] <description>
   ```

2. Call `handoff_sync_status` with `{ taskId: <HANDOFF_TASK_ID>, newStatus: "implementing", sourceTimestamp: "<current UTC ISO 8601>", direction: "aif_to_handoff", paused: true }`.
3. Call `handoff_push_plan` with `{ taskId: <HANDOFF_TASK_ID>, planContent: <synthetic content above> }`.
4. After successful execution, flip the checkbox to `- [x]` in the synthetic content and call `handoff_push_plan` again with the updated text.
5. Finalize sync:
   - If `HANDOFF_SKIP_REVIEW` is `1` → `handoff_sync_status` → `"done"` with `paused: false`.
   - Otherwise → `handoff_sync_status` → `"review"` with `paused: true`.

If `HANDOFF_TASK_ID` is missing → skip all MCP sync for this run.

**Docs policy (inline mode, driven by `--docs`):**

- `--docs=yes` → after completion, show the docs checkpoint (same AskUserQuestion as `Docs: yes` in regular mode) and route changes through `/aif-docs`.
- `--docs=no` → suppress the documentation checkpoint, emit `WARN [docs] --docs=no in inline mode; documentation checkpoint skipped`.
- `--docs=warn` (default) → emit `WARN [docs] Inline mode default is warn-only; documentation checkpoint skipped. Pass --docs=yes to enable.`

**Context maintenance in inline mode:**

- Resolved description artifact updates: allowed, same rules as regular mode (only factual deltas for new deps/integrations).
- Resolved architecture artifact + `AGENTS.md`: allowed only if new modules/folders were actually created.
- Resolved roadmap artifact: NOT updated in inline mode (no milestone linkage available without a plan).
- Resolved rules file: NOT edited in inline mode (same as regular).

**Completion output (inline mode):**

```
## Inline Implementation Complete

Task: <description>

Files modified:
- <file> (created|modified)
Documentation: <outcome per --docs>

What's next?

1. 🔍 /aif-verify — Verify the change (recommended)
2. 💾 /aif-commit — Commit directly
```

Then offer:

```
AskUserQuestion: Inline task complete. What's next?

Options:
1. Verify first — Run /aif-verify (recommended)
2. Skip to commit — Go straight to /aif-commit
```

→ **STOP** after the chosen follow-up completes. No summary document, no report file.

### Step 0.0: Resume / Recovery (after a break or after /clear)

If the user is resuming **the next day**, says the session was **abandoned**, or you suspect context was lost (e.g. after `/clear`), rebuild local context from the repo **before** continuing tasks:

If `git.enabled = true`:

```
1. git status
2. git branch --show-current
3. git log --oneline --decorate -20
4. (optional) git diff --stat
5. (optional) git stash list
```

If `git.enabled = false`, skip git recovery commands and reconcile only from the resolved plan/fix-plan paths plus the working tree state.

Then reconcile plan/task state:

- Ensure the current plan file matches the current branch when git branch plans are in use (`@plan-file` override wins; otherwise branch-named plan takes priority over the resolved fast plan).
- If `git.enabled = false` or full plans were created without a branch, prefer:
    - explicit `@plan-file`,
    - then the only `*.md` file in the configured plans dir,
    - then the resolved fast plan path.
- Compare `TaskList` statuses vs plan checkboxes.
    - If code changes for a task appear already implemented but the task is not marked completed, verify quickly and then `TaskUpdate(..., status: "completed")` and update the plan checkbox.
    - If a task is marked completed but the corresponding code is missing (rebase/reset happened), mark it back to pending and discuss with the user.

**If uncommitted changes exist:**

```
AskUserQuestion: You have uncommitted changes. Commit them first?

Options:
1. Yes, commit now (/aif-commit)
2. No, stash and continue
3. Cancel
```

**Based on choice:**

- Yes → run `/aif-commit`, then continue to plan discovery
- No → `git stash push -m "aif-implement: stash before plan execution"`, then continue
- Cancel → inform the user: "Implementation cancelled." → **STOP**

**If NO plan file exists but the resolved fix plan exists:**

A fix plan was created by `/aif-fix` in plan mode. Redirect to fix workflow:

```
Found a fix plan at the resolved fix plan path.

This plan was created by /aif-fix and should be executed through the fix workflow
(it creates a patch and handles cleanup automatically).

Running /aif-fix to execute the plan...
```

→ **Invoke `/aif-fix`** (without arguments – it will detect the resolved fix plan and execute it).
→ **STOP** — do not continue with implement workflow.

**If NO plan file exists AND no resolved fix plan (all tasks completed or fresh start):**

```
AskUserQuestion: No active plan found. Current branch: <current-branch>.
What would you like to do?

Options:
1. Start new feature from current branch
2. Return to configured base branch and start new feature
3. Create quick task plan (no branch)
4. Nothing, just checking status
```

**Based on choice:**

- New feature from current → `/aif-plan full <description>`
- Return to base branch → `git checkout <configured-base-branch>`, then `git pull origin <configured-base-branch>` → `/aif-plan full <description>` (git mode only)
- Quick task → `/aif-plan fast <description>`
- Nothing, just checking status → display branch info and recent commits summary → **STOP**

If `git.enabled = false`, replace option 2 with:

- `2. Create rich full plan without branch creation`
- Route it to `/aif-plan full <description>` without any git commands

**If plan file exists → continue to Step 0.1**

### Step 0.1: Load Project Context & Past Experience

Use the resolved config from Step 0:

- **Paths:** description, architecture, RULES.md, roadmap, research, plan files, patches, and rules dir
- **Language:** `language.ui` for prompts, `language.artifacts` for generated content
- **Rules hierarchy:** the resolved RULES.md file + `rules.base` + named `rules.<area>` entries

**Read `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md`** (use path from config) if it exists to understand:

- Tech stack (language, framework, database, ORM)
- Project architecture and conventions
- Non-functional requirements

**Read the resolved architecture artifact** if it exists (`paths.architecture`, default: `.ai-factory/ARCHITECTURE.md`) to understand:

- Chosen architecture pattern and folder structure
- Dependency rules (what depends on what)
- Layer/module boundaries and communication patterns
- Follow these conventions when implementing — file placement, imports, module boundaries

**Read the resolved RULES.md path** if it exists:

- These are project-specific rules and conventions added by the user
- **ALWAYS follow these rules** when implementing — they override general patterns
- Rules are short, actionable — treat each as a hard requirement

**Read rules hierarchy** (paths from config):

1. **RULES.md** – axioms (universal project rules)
2. **rules/base.md** — project-specific base conventions (naming, structure, patterns)
3. **rules.<area>** — area-specific rule entries resolved from config (for example `rules.api`, `rules.frontend`)

Load all available rule files and merge them. More specific rules override general ones.

**Read `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-implement/SKILL.md`** — MANDATORY if the file exists.

This file contains project-specific rules accumulated by `/aif-evolve` from patches,
codebase conventions, and tech-stack analysis. These rules are tailored to the current project.

**How to apply skill-context rules:**

- Treat them as **project-level overrides** for this skill's general instructions
- When a skill-context rule conflicts with a general rule written in this SKILL.md,
  **the skill-context rule wins** (more specific context takes priority — same principle as nested CLAUDE.md files)
- When there is no conflict, apply both: general rules from SKILL.md + project rules from skill-context
- Do NOT ignore skill-context rules even if they seem to contradict this skill's defaults —
  they exist because the project's experience proved the default insufficient
- **CRITICAL:** skill-context rules apply to ALL outputs of this skill — including the code
  you write and how you update plan checkboxes. If a skill-context rule says "code MUST follow X"
  or "implementation MUST include Y" — you MUST comply. Writing code that violates skill-context
  rules is a bug.

**Enforcement:** After generating any output artifact, verify it against all skill-context rules.
If any rule is violated — fix the output before presenting it to the user.

**Patch fallback (limited, only when skill-context is missing):**

- If `.ai-factory/skill-context/aif-implement/SKILL.md` does not exist and the resolved patches dir exists:
    - Use `Glob` to find `*.md` files in the resolved patches dir
    - Sort patch filenames ascending (lexical), then select the last **10** (or fewer if less exist)
    - Read those selected patch files only
    - Prioritize **Root Cause** and **Prevention** sections
- If skill-context exists, do **not** read all patches by default.
    - Optionally read a few targeted recent patches only when a task clearly matches a known failure pattern.

**Use this context when implementing:**

- Follow the specified tech stack
- Use correct import patterns and conventions
- Apply proper error handling and logging as specified
- Avoid pitfalls documented in skill-context rules and relevant fallback patches

### Step 0.2: Find Plan File

**If `$ARGUMENTS` contains `@<path>`:**

Use this explicit plan file and skip automatic plan discovery.

```
1. Extract path after "@"
2. Resolve relative to project root (absolute paths are also valid)
3. If file does not exist:
   "Plan file not found: <path>
    Provide an existing markdown plan file, for example:
    - /aif-implement @<resolved fast plan path>
    - /aif-implement @.ai-factory/plans/feature-user-auth.md"
   → STOP
4. If file is the resolved fix plan path:
   → invoke /aif-fix (ownership + cleanup workflow) and STOP
5. Otherwise use this file as the active plan
```

Then continue with normal execution using the selected plan file.

**If no `@<path>` override is provided, check plan files in this order:**

**Check for plan files in this order:**

```
1. Check current git branch:
   git branch --show-current
   → Convert branch name to filename: replace "/" with "-" (this is <branch-slug>)
   → Resolve full-mode plan filename in this order:
     a. When `workflow.plan_id_format = sequential`, glob
        `<configured plans dir>/[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]_<branch-slug>.md`.
        - 0 matches → fall through to step (b).
        - 1 match → use it.
        - >1 matches → use the **highest-numbered** match and emit
          `WARN [aif-implement] multiple sequential plans for <branch>: <list>; using <chosen>`.
     b. `<configured plans dir>/<branch-slug>.md` (default behavior, also used as
        the fallback when sequential glob returned 0 matches).
2. If git mode is off or no branch-based plan is found above:
   - Check whether the configured plans dir contains exactly one `*.md` plan file created by `/aif-plan full` without a branch
   - If exactly one exists → use it
   - If multiple exist → ask the user to choose or use `@<path>`
3. No full-mode plan → Check the resolved fast plan path
4. No full-mode plan and no resolved fast plan → Check the resolved fix plan path
   → If exists: invoke /aif-fix (handles its own workflow with patches) and STOP
```

**Priority:**

1. `@<path>` argument - explicit user-selected plan file
2. Branch-named file (from `/aif-plan full`) - if it matches current branch
3. Single named full-plan file in `paths.plans` (from `/aif-plan full` without branch creation)
4. `paths.plan` (from `/aif-plan fast`) - fallback when no full plan exists
5. `paths.fix_plan` - redirect to `/aif-fix` (from `/aif-fix` plan mode)

**Note:** Plan discovery scans `paths.plans/` only. Plans archived to `paths.archive/plans/` by `/aif-archive` are excluded from discovery.

**Read the plan file** to understand:

- Context and settings (testing, logging preferences)
- Commit checkpoints (when to commit)
- Task dependencies
- Task checklist format (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) to keep progress synced

**Immediately after reading the plan file, check the first line for `<!-- handoff:task:<uuid> -->`:**

- If found AND `HANDOFF_MODE` is NOT `1` (manual session): extract the task ID. This is the Handoff task ID for MCP sync throughout this session. Call `handoff_sync_status` with `{ taskId: <extracted-id>, newStatus: "implementing", sourceTimestamp: "<current UTC time in ISO 8601 format, e.g. 2026-04-02T18:30:45.000Z>", direction: "aif_to_handoff", paused: true }`. The timestamp must reflect the actual current time, not midnight or an approximation.
- If found AND `HANDOFF_MODE` is `1`: the Handoff coordinator handles sync — do nothing.
- If NOT found: no linked Handoff task — skip all MCP sync for the rest of this session.

### Step 1: Load Current State

```
TaskList → Get all tasks with status
```

Find:

- Next pending task (not blocked, not completed)
- Any in_progress tasks (resume these first)

### Step 2: Display Progress

```
## Implementation Progress

✅ Completed: 3/8 tasks
🔄 In Progress: Task #4 - Implement search service
⏳ Pending: 4 tasks

Current task: #4 - Implement search service
```

### Step 3: Execute Current Task

For each task:

**3.1: Fetch full details**

```
TaskGet(taskId) → Get description, files, context
```

**3.2: Mark as in_progress**

```
TaskUpdate(taskId, status: "in_progress")
```

**3.3: Implement the task**

- Read relevant files
- Make necessary changes
- Follow existing code patterns
- **NO tests unless plan includes test tasks**
- **NO reports or summaries**

**3.4: Verify implementation**

- Check code compiles/runs
- Verify functionality works
- Fix any immediate issues

**3.5: Mark as completed**

```
TaskUpdate(taskId, status: "completed")
```

**3.6: Update checkbox in plan file**

**IMMEDIATELY** after completing a task, update the checkbox in the plan file:

```markdown
# Before

- [ ] Task 1: Create user model

# After

- [x] Task 1: Create user model
```

**This is MANDATORY** — checkboxes must reflect actual progress:

- Use `Edit` tool to change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
- Do this RIGHT AFTER each task completion
- Even if deletion will be offered later
- Plan file is the source of truth for progress

**Handoff sync (manual mode ONLY — skip when `HANDOFF_MODE` is `1`):** If a Handoff task ID was extracted in Step 0.2, call `handoff_push_plan` with `{ taskId: <id>, planContent: <full updated plan text> }` to sync the checklist progress.

**3.7: Update the resolved description artifact if needed**

If during implementation:

- New dependency/library was added
- Tech stack changed (e.g., added Redis, switched ORM)
- New integration added (e.g., Stripe, SendGrid)
- Architecture decision was made

→ Update the resolved description artifact (`paths.description`, default: `.ai-factory/DESCRIPTION.md`) to reflect the change:

```markdown
## Tech Stack

- **Cache:** Redis (added for session storage)
```

This keeps the resolved description artifact as the source of truth.

**3.7.1: Update AGENTS.md and ARCHITECTURE.md if project structure changed**

If during implementation:

- New directories or modules were created
- Project structure changed significantly (new `src/modules/`, new API routes directory, etc.)
- New entry points or key files were added

→ Update `AGENTS.md` — refresh the "Project Structure" tree and "Key Entry Points" table to reflect new directories/files.

→ Update the resolved architecture artifact — if new modules or layers were added that should be documented in the folder structure section.

**Only update if structure actually changed** — don't rewrite on every task. Check if new directories were created that aren't in the current structure map.

**3.8: Check for commit checkpoint**

If the plan has commit checkpoints and current task is at a checkpoint:

```
AskUserQuestion: ✅ Tasks <first>-<last> completed. This is a commit checkpoint. Ready to commit? Suggested message: "<conventional commit message>"

Options:
1. Yes, commit now (/aif-commit)
2. No, continue to next task
3. Skip all commit checkpoints
```

**Based on choice:**

- Yes, commit now → invoke `/aif-commit` with the suggested message, then continue to next task
- No, continue to next task → proceed to the next task without committing
- Skip all commit checkpoints → for all subsequent checkpoints within this `/aif-implement` run, skip the prompt automatically and proceed directly to the next task (as if user selected "No, continue to next task" each time). This is in-context memory — resets on `/clear` or new session

**3.9: Move to next task or pause**

### Step 4: Session Persistence

Progress is automatically saved via TaskUpdate.

**To pause:**

```
Current progress saved.

Completed: 4/8 tasks
Next task: #5 - Add pagination support

To resume later, run:
/aif-implement
```

**To resume (next session):**

```
/aif-implement
```

→ Automatically finds next incomplete task

### Step 5: Completion

**Handoff sync (manual mode ONLY — skip entirely when `HANDOFF_MODE` is `1`):** If a Handoff task ID was extracted from the plan annotation AND `HANDOFF_MODE` is NOT `1`:
1. Call `handoff_push_plan` with `{ taskId: <id>, planContent: <final updated plan text> }`.
2. If `HANDOFF_SKIP_REVIEW` is `1`: call `handoff_sync_status` with `{ taskId: <id>, newStatus: "done", sourceTimestamp: "<current UTC time in ISO 8601 format>", direction: "aif_to_handoff", paused: false }`.
3. Otherwise: call `handoff_sync_status` with `{ taskId: <id>, newStatus: "review", sourceTimestamp: "<current UTC time in ISO 8601 format>", direction: "aif_to_handoff", paused: true }`.

When all tasks are done:

```
## Implementation Complete

All 8 tasks completed.

Documentation: updated existing docs | created docs/<feature-slug>.md | skipped by user | warn-only (Docs: no/unset)

What's next?

1. 🔍 /aif-verify — Verify nothing was missed (recommended)
2. 💾 /aif-commit — Commit the changes directly
```

**Check ROADMAP.md progress:**

If the resolved roadmap artifact exists:

1. Read it
   1.1. If the plan file includes `## Roadmap Linkage` with a non-`none` milestone, prefer that milestone for completion marking
2. Check if the completed work corresponds to any unchecked milestone
3. If yes — mark it `[x]` and add entry to the Completed table with today's date
4. Tell the user which milestone was marked done

### Context Maintenance (Artifacts)

Only do this step when there is something concrete to capture.

**DESCRIPTION.md (allowed in this command):**

- If this plan introduced new dependencies/integrations or changed the stack, update the resolved description artifact with factual deltas only.
- Do not rewrite unrelated sections.

**ARCHITECTURE.md + AGENTS.md (allowed in this command):**

- If new modules/layers/folders were added (or dependency rules changed), update the resolved architecture artifact to reflect the new structure and constraints.
- If you maintain `AGENTS.md` structure maps or entry points, refresh them only when they are now incorrect.

**ROADMAP.md (allowed, limited):**

- This command may mark milestone completion when evidence is clear.
- If milestone mapping is ambiguous, emit `WARN [roadmap] ...` and suggest the owner command:
    - `/aif-roadmap check`
    - or `/aif-roadmap <short update request>`

**RULES.md (NOT allowed in this command):**

- Never edit the resolved `paths.rules_file` artifact from `/aif-implement`.
- If you discovered repeatable conventions/pitfalls during implementation, propose up to 3 candidate rules and ask the user to add them via `/aif-rules`.
- Do not invoke `/aif-rules` automatically (it is user-invoked).

If candidate rules exist:

```
AskUserQuestion: Capture new project rules in the resolved RULES.md artifact?

Options:
1. Yes — output `/aif-rules ...` commands (recommended)
2. No — skip
```

**Documentation policy checkpoint (after completion, before plan cleanup):**

Read the plan file setting `Docs: yes/no`.

If plan setting is `Docs: yes`:

```
AskUserQuestion: Documentation checkpoint — how should we document this feature?

Options:
1. Update existing docs (recommended) — invoke /aif-docs
2. Create a new feature doc page — invoke /aif-docs with feature-page context
3. Skip documentation
```

Handling:

- Option 1 → invoke `/aif-docs` to update README/docs based on completed work
- Option 2 → invoke `/aif-docs` with context to create `docs/<feature-slug>.md`, include sections (Summary, Usage/user-facing behavior, Configuration, API/CLI changes, Examples, Troubleshooting, See Also), and add a README docs-table link
- Option 3 → do not invoke `/aif-docs`; emit `WARN [docs] Documentation skipped by user`

If plan setting is `Docs: no` or setting is unset:

- Do **not** show a mandatory docs checkpoint prompt
- Do **not** invoke `/aif-docs` automatically
- Emit `WARN [docs] Docs policy is no/unset; skipping documentation checkpoint`

**Always include documentation outcome in the final completion output:**

- `Documentation: updated existing docs`
- `Documentation: created docs/<feature-slug>.md`
- `Documentation: skipped by user`
- `Documentation: warn-only (Docs: no/unset)`

**Handle plan file after completion:**

- **If the resolved fast plan path** (from `/aif-plan fast`):

  ```
  AskUserQuestion: Would you like to delete the resolved fast plan file? (It's no longer needed)

  Options:
  1. Yes, delete it
  2. No, keep it
  ```

  **Based on choice:**
    - "Yes, delete it" → delete the file:
      ```bash
      rm <resolved fast plan path>
      ```
    - "No, keep it" → leave the file as is, continue to the next step

- **If branch-named file** (e.g., `<configured plans dir>/feature-user-auth.md`):
    - Keep it - documents what was done
    - User can delete before merging if desired

**Check if running in a git worktree:**

Detect worktree context:

```bash
# If .git is a file (not a directory), we're in a worktree
[ -f .git ]
```

**If we ARE in a worktree**, offer to merge back and clean up:

```
You're working in a parallel worktree.

  Branch:    <current-branch>
  Worktree:  <current-directory>
  Main repo: <main-repo-path>

AskUserQuestion: Would you like to merge this branch into the configured base branch and clean up?

Options:
1. Yes, merge and clean up (recommended)
2. No, I'll handle it manually
```

**Based on choice:**

- "Yes, merge and clean up" → follow the Worktree Merge procedure below
- "No, I'll handle it manually" → show a reminder:
  ```
  To merge and clean up later:
    cd <main-repo-path>
    git merge <branch>
    /aif-plan --cleanup <branch>
  ```

#### Worktree Merge

1. **Ensure everything is committed** — check `git status`. If uncommitted changes exist, suggest `/aif-commit` first and wait.

2. **Get repository root path:**

   ```bash
   MAIN_REPO=$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir | sed 's|/\.git$||')
   BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   ```

3. **Switch to the repository root:**

   ```bash
   cd "${MAIN_REPO}"
   ```

4. **Merge the branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout <configured-base-branch>
   git pull origin <configured-base-branch>
   git merge "${BRANCH}"
   ```

   If merge conflict occurs:

   ```
   ⚠️  Merge conflict detected. Resolve manually:
     cd <main-repo-path>
     git merge --abort   # to cancel
     # or resolve conflicts and git commit
   ```

   → STOP here, do not proceed with cleanup.

5. **Remove worktree and branch (only if merge succeeded):**

   ```bash
   git worktree remove <worktree-path>
   git branch -d "${BRANCH}"
   ```

6. **Confirm:**

   ```
   ✅ Merged and cleaned up!

     Branch <branch> merged into <configured-base-branch>.
     Worktree removed.

   You're now in: <main-repo-path> (<configured-base-branch>)
   ```

→ **STOP** — worktree merged and removed, no further steps needed.

### Final Step — Verify or Commit

```
AskUserQuestion: All tasks complete. What's next?

Options:
1. Verify first — Run /aif-verify to check completeness (recommended)
2. Skip to commit — Go straight to /aif-commit
```

**Based on choice:**

- "Verify first" → invoke `/aif-verify` → after it completes, continue to context cleanup below
- "Skip to commit" → invoke `/aif-commit` → after it completes, continue to context cleanup below

**Context cleanup (after verify or commit):**

Suggest the user to free up context space if needed: `/clear` (full reset) or `/compact` (compress history).

**IMPORTANT: NO summary reports, NO analysis documents, NO wrap-up tasks.**

## Commands

### Start/Resume Implementation

```
/aif-implement
```

Continues from next incomplete task.

### List Available Plans

```
/aif-implement --list
```

Lists the resolved fast plan path, resolved fix plan path, and current-branch `<configured plans dir>/<branch>.md` (or `<configured plans dir>/<NNNN>_<branch>.md` when `workflow.plan_id_format = sequential`), then exits without implementation.

### Use Explicit Plan File

```
/aif-implement @my-custom-plan.md
/aif-implement @.ai-factory/plans/feature-user-auth.md status
```

Uses the provided plan file instead of auto-detecting by branch/default files.

### Inline Implementation (No Plan)

```
/aif-implement --without-plan add GET /healthz endpoint returning {"status":"ok"}
/aif-implement --without-plan rename LogLevel.VERBOSE to LogLevel.TRACE --docs=yes
```

One-shot execution of a small task without any plan file. Mutually exclusive with `@plan-file`, `status`, and task id. Does not create `FIX_PLAN.md` or patches. Default docs policy is `warn`; pass `--docs=yes` to run the docs checkpoint, `--docs=no` to silence the warning. See **Step 0.inline** for the full flow.

### Start from Specific Task

```
/aif-implement 5
```

Starts from task #5 (useful for skipping or re-doing).

### Check Status Only

```
/aif-implement status
```

Shows progress without executing.

## Execution Rules

### DO:

- ✅ Execute one task at a time
- ✅ Mark tasks in_progress before starting
- ✅ Mark tasks completed after finishing
- ✅ Follow existing code conventions
- ✅ Follow `/aif-best-practices` guidelines (naming, structure, error handling)
- ✅ Create files mentioned in task description
- ✅ Handle edge cases mentioned in task
- ✅ Stop and ask if task is unclear

### DON'T:

- ❌ Write tests (unless explicitly in task list)
- ❌ Create report files
- ❌ Create summary documents
- ❌ Add tasks not in the plan
- ❌ Skip tasks without user permission
- ❌ Mark incomplete tasks as done
- ❌ Violate the resolved architecture artifact conventions for file placement and module boundaries

## Artifact Ownership Boundaries

- Primary ownership in this command: task execution state and plan progress checkboxes.
- Allowed context artifact updates: the resolved description artifact, the resolved architecture artifact, and roadmap milestone completion in the resolved roadmap artifact when implementation evidence justifies it.
- Read-only context in this command by default: the resolved `paths.rules_file` and `paths.research` artifacts.
- Context-gate findings should be communicated as `WARN`/`ERROR` outputs only; this does not replace the required verbose implementation logging rules below.

For progress display format, blocker handling, session continuity examples, and full flow examples → see `references/IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER write tests** unless task list explicitly includes test tasks
2. **NEVER create reports** or summary documents after completion
3. **ALWAYS mark task in_progress** before starting work
4. **ALWAYS mark task completed** after finishing
5. **ALWAYS update checkbox in plan file** - `- [ ]` → `- [x]` immediately after task completion
6. **PRESERVE progress** - tasks survive session boundaries
7. **ONE task at a time** - focus on current task only

## CRITICAL: Logging Requirements

**ALWAYS add verbose logging when implementing code.** For logging guidelines, patterns, and management requirements → read `references/LOGGING-GUIDE.md`

Key rules: log function entry/exit, state changes, external calls, error context. Use structured logging, configurable log levels (LOG_LEVEL env var).

**DO NOT skip logging to "keep code clean" - verbose logging is REQUIRED during implementation, but MUST be configurable.**
